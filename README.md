# Adverse Childhood Experiences and Asthma in the United States
## A Cross-Sectional Analysis using the 2022 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Dataset: https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_2022.html

### Purpose of this project: This study aimed to investigate the influence of individual ACEs on asthma prevalence in the US and explored how race, as a proxy for systemic racism, intersects with ACEs to exacerbate asthma risk.

### METHODS
Using cross-sectional data from the 2022 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), this study analyzed asthma prevalence among individuals reporting ACEs in the US. We were left with a total sample size of 79,238 people who reported an asthma outcome. The Mantel-Haenszel test for heterogeneity was employed for each of the 13 ACE questions to identify the two ACEs most strongly associated with asthma. Subsequently, a stratified analysis assessed differences in ACE/asthma associations among racialized groups. For each analysis, we controlled for age group and sex variables.

### RESULTS
The two ACEs with the strongest association to adult asthma were (1) living with someone with a mental illness (PR=1.75, 95% CI: 1.68, 1.82 relative to no experience living with someone with a mental illness), and (2) experiencing sexual abuse (PR=1.91, 95% CI: 1.81, 2.03 relative to not experiencing sexual abuse). Race did not modify the relationship between asthma and living with someone who has mental illness. However, race did modify the relationship between asthma and experiencing sexual abuse. Sexual abuse (relative to no sexual abuse) was associated with a higher prevalence of asthma among white individuals (PR=1.94, 95% CI: 1.81, 2.07) than among Black individuals (PR=1.62, 95% CI: 1.32, 1.98).

### CONCLUSIONS
ACEs such as living with someone with a mental illness and sexual abuse are associated with adult asthma. While the association between childhood sexual abuse and asthma differs by race, the association between asthma and living with someone who has mental illness does not. Future policy directions should prioritize resource allocation based on the varying magnitudes of trauma from ACEs, distinguishing between the impact of ACEs such as unmet needs and experiences such as sexual abuse.
